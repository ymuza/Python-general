"""Imagine you created an application for the departmental store. Looks simple?
Initially, there was one and only one type of discount called the On-Sale-Discount.
So. everything was going with ease and there was no difficulty for maintaining such a
simple application for a developer but as time passes, the owner of the departmental
store demands for including some other types of discount also for the customers.
It is very easy to say to make these changes but definitely not very easy to implement
these changes in an efficient way."""

"""Solution using Strategy method
-----------------------------------
Letâ€™s see how can we solve the above-described problem in an efficient way. 
We can create a specific class that will extract all the algorithms into separate 
classes called Strategy. Out actual class should store the reference to one of the strategy class."""
